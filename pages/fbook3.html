        <h1><b>The English Teacher</b></h1>
        <p><i>The English Teacher is a 1945 novel written by R. K. Narayan. It is a part of a series of novels and collections of short stories set in "Malgudi". The English Teacher was preceded by Swami and Friends, The Bachelor of Arts and Malgudi Days, and followed by Mr. Sampath â€“ The Printer of Malgudi.This novel, dedicated to Narayan's wife Rajam, is not only autobiographical but also poignant in its intensity of feeling. The story is a series of experiences in the life of Krishna, an English teacher, and his quest for inner peace and self-development after the traumatising death of his wife.</i></p>
